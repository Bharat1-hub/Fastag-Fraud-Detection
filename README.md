Project Overview:

I conducted a detailed analysis of Fastag transaction data, uncovering fraudulent patterns and implementing machine learning models to predict fraud cases effectively.

✅ Key Aspects of the Project:

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified hidden patterns and anomalies in transaction data.
✔️ Fraud Pattern Detection: Analyzed transaction mismatches and lane-based fraud trends.
✔️ Machine Learning Models: Developed and compared multiple models for fraud prediction.
✔️ Data Visualization: Used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to generate insights.

📊 Key Findings:

📌 Motorcycles had zero fraudulent cases.
📌 Express lanes recorded higher fraud percentages compared to regular lanes.
📌 Most fraud occurred when the transaction amount didn’t match the actual payment.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented:

🔹 Logistic Regression – Probability-based fraud classification.
🔹 Decision Tree – Identified key fraud indicators.
🔹 Random Forest – Improved prediction accuracy with multiple decision trees.
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Classified transactions based on similarity.
🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Enhanced fraud classification for complex patterns.
